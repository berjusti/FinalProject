# FinalProject

The final project goal is to understand BERTopic and Sentiment Analysis



PROJECT NLP: BERTopic understanding of the subject using a team to analyze a dataset of 24,000 customer reviews from an e-commerce platform:



Day 1: Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing

Gather the dataset: Obtain the 24,000 customer reviews from the e-commerce platform. Ensure the dataset contains relevant information, such as review text and associated ratings or sentiments.
Data cleaning: Remove any irrelevant or noisy data, such as duplicate reviews, empty reviews, or irrelevant columns. Perform basic data cleaning steps, including removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and handling missing values if any.
Text preprocessing: Apply preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization to prepare the text data for analysis. This step helps to standardize the text and improve the quality of the results.


Day 2: Topic Modeling with BERTopic

Install necessary libraries: Set up the required Python environment and install the BERTopic library along with any other dependencies.
Topic extraction: Implement BERTopic on the preprocessed dataset to extract meaningful topics from the customer reviews. This step involves training a BERTopic model on the text data and obtaining topic representations.
Topic interpretation: Analyze and interpret the generated topics by exploring the most representative keywords and reviewing the associated customer reviews. This step helps in understanding the main themes or categories within the dataset.

Day 3: Topic Analysis and Visualization

Topic analysis: Perform an in-depth analysis of each topic to gain insights into customer sentiments, preferences, or common issues. Use techniques like sentiment analysis or frequency analysis to understand the sentiment distribution within each topic.
Visualize topics: Utilize data visualization techniques such as word clouds, bar charts, or heatmaps to present the topics and associated insights in an easily understandable format. This step helps in communicating the findings effectively.


Day 4: API Development for GPT Integration (an add on - MVP - generate suitable request)

Design API specifications: Determine the desired functionality and endpoints for the API that will integrate with GPT.
Develop the API, Define the necessary routes, request/response formats, and integrate the BERTopic model and GPT into the API endpoints. Ensure the API is well-documented and follows best practices.
Test the API: Perform thorough testing of the API to ensure it functions correctly. Use sample inputs and evaluate the generated responses to verify the integration between BERTopic and GPT.


Day 5: Presentation Preparation

Prepare presentation content: Summarize the key findings, insights, and visualizations from the topic analysis and GPT integration. Craft a narrative that effectively conveys the value of the analysis and the capabilities of the developed API.
Create slides or other visual aids: Develop visually appealing slides or other presentation materials to support the content. Use appropriate charts, graphs, or screenshots to illustrate the topics and demonstrate the API functionalities.
Rehearse and refine: Practice the presentation with the team, seeking feedback and making improvements as needed. Ensure the presentation flows smoothly and effectively communicates the team's work.
Remember to adapt the plan based on your team's capabilities, available resources, and specific requirements.
